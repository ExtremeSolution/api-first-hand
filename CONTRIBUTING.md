# Contributing to API-First-Hand

We are happy to accept your contributions to make our project better and more awesome! To avoid unnecessary work on either side, please stick to the following process:

1. Check if there is already [an issue](https://github.com/zalando/api-first-hand/issues) for your concern.
2. If there is not, open a new one to start a discussion. We hate to close finished PRs!
3. If we decide your concern needs code changes, we would be happy to accept a pull request.
4. Pull requests must always contain tests for the functionality implemented / fixed (85% or greater). Please follow the current coding style (ask for help when it's not clear).

In case you just want to help out and don't know where to start, [issues with the "help wanted" label](https://github.com/zalando/api-first-hand/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) are good for first-time contributors.
